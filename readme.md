[json2html] (https://github.com/moappi/json2html) adaptation using javascript DOM manipulation
==============

*If you haven't checked out json2html by moappi, do it. This project completely relies on that project.*

json2html templates html in json objects. When put through a transform, the html is returned as text. I would rather return an html element, so I took an hour and adapted the original project to do just that.

All credit goes to those who contributed to the original json2html. I really didn't do anything here, just adapt some stuff.

Any thoughts can be sent to lchowardjr@gmail.com and are appreciated.
